/**
 * This workflow marks one or more orders as completed. It's used by the [Complete Cart Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders_postordersidcomplete).
 * 
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the completed orders. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that 
 * allows you to update custom data models linked to the orders.
 * 
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around order completion.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await completeOrderWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     orderIds: ["order_1", "order_2"],
 *     additional_data: {
 *       send_webhook: true,
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * 
 * @summary
 * 
 * Complete one or more orders.
 * 
 * @property hooks.ordersCompleted - This hook is executed after the orders are completed. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the completed orders.
