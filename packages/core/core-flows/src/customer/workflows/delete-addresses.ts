 * This workflow deletes one or more customer addresses. It's used by the

 * and the [Remove Customer Addresses Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#customers_deletecustomersmeaddressesaddress_id).
 * 
 * :::note
 * 
 * This workflow deletes addresses created by the [Customer Module](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/customer)
 * only. So, you can't delete addresses attached to a cart, for example. To do that, use the workflow
 * relevant to that module.
 * 
 * :::
 * 
 * You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to 
 * delete customer addresses in your custom flows.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await deleteCustomerAddressesWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     ids: [
 *       "cuaddress_123"
 *     ]
 *   }
 * })
 * 
 * @summary
 * 
 * Delete one or more customer addresses.
 * 
 * @property hooks.addressesDeleted - This hook is executed after the addresses are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions.
