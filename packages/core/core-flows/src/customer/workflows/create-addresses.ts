/**
 * This workflow creates one or more addresses for customers. It's used by the [Add Customer Address Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#customers_postcustomersidaddresses)
 * and the [Add Customer Address Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#customers_postcustomersmeaddresses).
 * 
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created customer addresses. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
 * allows you to create custom data models linked to the addresses.
 * 
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around creating customer addresses.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await createCustomerAddressesWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     addresses: [
 *       {
 *         customer_id: "cus_123",
 *         address_1: "456 Elm St",
 *         city: "Los Angeles",
 *         country_code: "us",
