/**
 * This workflow creates one or more customers. It's used by the [Create Customer Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#customers_postcustomers).
 * 
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created customer. You can see an example in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/customer/extend).
 * 
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around creating customers.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await createCustomersWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     customersData: [
 *       {
 *         first_name: "John",
 *         last_name: "Doe",
 *         email: "john.doe@example.com",
 *       },
 *     ],
 *     additional_data: {
 *       position_name: "Editor",
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * 
 * @summary
 * 
 * Create one or more customers.
 * 
 * @property hooks.customersCreated - This hook is executed after the customers are created. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the created customers.
