 * This workflow creates a fulfillment, which can be used for an order, return, exchanges, and similar concepts.
 * The workflow is used by the [Create Fulfillment Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#fulfillments_postfulfillments).
 * 
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to
 * create a fulfillment within your custom flows.
 * 
 * :::note
 * 
 * You can retrieve an order's details using [Query](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query),
 * or [useQueryGraphStep](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/references/medusa-workflows/steps/useQueryGraphStep).
 *

 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await createFulfillmentWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     location_id: "sloc_123",
