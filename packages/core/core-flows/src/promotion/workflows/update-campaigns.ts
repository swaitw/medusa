/**
 * This workflow updates one or more campaigns. It's used by the [Update Campaign Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#campaigns_postcampaignsid).
 * 
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the updated campaigns. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
 * allows you to update custom data models linked to the campaigns.
 * 
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around updating campaigns.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await updateCampaignsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     campaignsData: [
 *       {
 *         id: "camp_123",
 *         name: "Launch Promotions",
 *         ends_at: new Date("2026-01-01"),
 *       }
 *     ],
 *     additional_data: {
 *       target_audience: "new_customers"
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * 
 * @summary
 * 
 * Update one or more campaigns.
 * 
 * @property hooks.campaignsUpdated - This hook is executed after the campaigns are updated. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the updated campaigns.
