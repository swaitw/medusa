/**
 * This workflow creates one or more collections. It's used by the 
 * [Create Collection Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#collections_postcollections).
 * 
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created collections. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that 
 * allows you to create custom data models linked to the product collections.
 * 
 * You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product-collection creation.
 * 
 * @example
 * const { result } = await createCollectionsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     collections: [
 *       {
 *         title: "Summer Clothing"
 *       }
 *     ],
 *     additional_data: {
 *       erp_id: "123"
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * 
 * @summary
 * 
 * Create one or more product collections.
 * 
 * @property hooks.collectionsCreated - This hook is executed after the collections are created. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the created collections.
