## Create Inventory Item

To create an inventory item:

1. Go to the Inventory page from the sidebar.
2. Click on the Create button at the top right.

    1. Details step:
        - Enter the inventory item's title and SKU in their respective fields.
        - Optionally enter a description.
        - If the inventory item shouldn't be shipped when its variant is purchased, toggle off the "Requires shipping" option. This is useful when the inventory item is a digital product, for example.
        - Optionally add the inventory item's attributes, including width, length, height, weight, MID code, HS code, country of origin, and material.
        - Once you're done, click the Next button.
    2. Availability step using the [Bulk Editor](../../tips/bulk-editor/page.mdx):
        - If you have locations in your store, which you can create in [Settings](../../settings/locations-and-shipping/locations/page.mdx), you can specify the inventory item's quantity in each location.
4. Once you're done, click the Save button.
