In this guide, you’ll learn how to manage reservations in your store.

## What is a Reservation?

A reservation is a reserved quantity of an inventory item. Medusa automatically creates reservations for inventory items whose variants are purchased. This ensures that the inventory item is not sold to another customer while the order is being processed. Once the item in the order is fulfilled, the reservation is removed.

You can also manually create reservations for inventory items. For example, you can reserve a quantity of an inventory item for an offline sale or a customer who has requested a reservation.

### View Reservations

To view reservations, go to Inventory from the sidebar, then click the Reservations sub-item shown in the sidebar.

In the list, you can see reservation details such as the SKU and reserved quantity. You can also search, filter, and sort the reservations to find the specific item you are looking for.

2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="arrow" /> icon at the right of the "Metadata" section.
3. In the side window that opens:
    - Manage the key-value pairs in the table.
    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
