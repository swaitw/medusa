In this guide, you’ll learn what claims are, how to create them, and more.

## Order Claims Overview

If a customer receives faulty or incorrect items for an order, you can create a claim. A claim allows you to either replace or return an item for a customer, then issue a refund.

## Create a Claim

<Note type="warning">

Changes made by a claim can't be canceled. Make sure to review the claim before confirming it.

</Note>

You can create an order claim after the order's items have been [delivered](../fulfillments/page.mdx#mark-fulfillment-as-delivered).

To create an order claim:

1. Go to an order’s details page.
2. In the Summary section, click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon at the top right.
3. Choose "Create Claim" from the dropdown.
4. In the form that opens:
    - To add items to be returned:
        - Click on the "Add items" button in the "Inbound" section.
        - In the list that opens, click on the checkbox next to the items you want the customer to return.
        - Once done, click on the "Save" button.
        - You can then change the quantity to return or manage the item's details by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon next to it.
    - For the inbound items:
        - For the Location field, choose the location to return the items to.
        - For the Return Shipping field, you can optionally choose the shipping method to return the items with.
            - Choosing a return shipping method adds its cost to the claim total. You can modify the cost by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={PencilSquare} alt="edit" /> icon next to the Return Shipping total, then entering the new cost.
    - You can optionally add an outbound item to be sent to the customer in replacement:
        - Click on the "Add items" button in the "Outbound" section.
        - In the list that opens, click on the checkbox next to the items you want to send to the customer.
        - Once done, click on the "Save" button.
        - You can then change the quantity to send or remove the item by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon next to it and choosing "Remove" from the dropdown.
    - For outbound items, choose the shipping method used to send the items in the Outbound Shipping field.
        - The shipping method's cost is added to the claim total. To edit its cost:
            - Click the <InlineIcon Icon={PencilSquare} alt="edit" /> icon next to the Outbound Shipping total.
            - Enter the new cost in the input shown.
    - If you want the customer to receive a notification that a claim has been created, check the “Send notifications” toggle.
5. Once done, click on the "Confirm Claim" button, then confirm the action by clicking the "Continue" button in the pop-up.

The claim will be created and you can see it in the Activity section of the order’s details page. If you added outbound items, they will also be added to the "Unfulfilled Items" section.

## Handle Outstanding Payment of a Claim

After creating a claim, you can check if there are any outstanding amounts (to be captured from the customer or returned) in the Summary section.

To handle outstanding amounts by refunding or capturing the payment, refer to the [Payments guide](../payments/page.mdx#handling-outstanding-amounts).

---

## Managing Returned Items in a Claim

The items to be returned from the customer as part of the claim can be managed similarly to a return. Once you receive the items from the customer, you can mark them as received as explained in the [Returns guide](../returns/page.mdx#mark-return-items-as-received).

---

## Fulfill Outbound Items in a Claim

As mentioned earlier, the outbound items of a claim are added into the "Unfulfilled Items" section. To fulfill and deliver these items to the customer, refer to the [Fulfillment guide](../fulfillments/page.mdx#create-fulfillment).
