## Allocate Order Items Manually

If Medusa manages the inventory of an ordered item, it reserves or allocates the ordered quantity from the inventory. This ensures that the item's available quantity is reduced by the ordered quantity.

Medusa allocates the ordered quantity from the stock location of the chosen shipping option in the order. For example, if the customer chooses a shipping option that uses a stock location in the US, Medusa allocates the ordered quantity from that stock location.

However, in some cases you may need to allocate an item manually, such as if you [edit the order](../edit/page.mdx) if you changed the inventory management configurations of the item's product variant. You'll find next to the item's name in the Summary section a "Not allocated" badge.

![Not Allocated Badge](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739546156/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_5.14.59_PM_fgc2d2.png)

To allocate these items manually:

1. Go to the Summary section of the order's details page.
2. If one or more items haven't been allocated, you'll find an "Allocate items" button at the bottom of the section. Click on it.
3. In the form that opens:
  1. For the Location field, choose the location to allocate the item from.
  2. In the Items to Allocate section, enter the quantity to allocate for each item.
4. Once you're done, click the "Allocate Items" button.

![Allocate Items Form](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739545718/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_5.07.46_PM_mzi0bg.png)

## Edit Email Address

You can edit the email address of an order to send order-update notifications to a new email address. This doesn't update the associated customer's address or transfer the order to a new customer. To transfer the order to a new customer, see the [Transfer Customer Ownership](#transfer-customer-ownership) section.

![Edit Email Address Form](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739546558/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_5.22.06_PM_fmrnc6.png)

## Transfer Customer Ownership

You can transfer the ownership of an order to another registered customer. This changes the customer associated with the order and sends notifications for order updates to the new customer.

<Note>

You can't transfer ownership to a guest customer, and that includes customers you create through the admin dashboard.

</Note>

When you transfer the ownership of an order, the original customer will receive a notification, such as an email, requesting their approval for the transfer. The order is transferred to the new customer only after the original customer approves the transfer.

To transfer the ownership of an order to another customer:

1. Open the order details page.
2. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dot" /> icon at the top right of the Customer section.
3. Click on "Transfer ownership" from the dropdown.
4. In the side window that opens, choose the new customer from the dropdown under the "New owner" section.
5. Once done, click on the Save button.

The original customer will then receive a notification requesting their approval for the transfer.

<Note>

If a notification isn't sent, check with your technical team to debug the integrated notification service.

</Note>

## Cancel an Order

You can cancel an order if no actions have been performed on it, such as payment captured or items fulfilled. Canceling an order will change its status to canceled and notify the customer about the cancellation.

<Note type="warning">

Canceling an order is irreversible.

</Note>

To cancel an order:

1. Open the order details page.
2. In the first section showing the order’s number, click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> at its right.
3. Click on Cancel from the dropdown.
4. Confirm canceling the order by clicking the “Continue” button in the pop-up.

If the order has been paid for or fulfilled, you'll receive an error message preventing you from canceling the order. Otherwise, the order will be canceled.
