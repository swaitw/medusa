3. Optionally enter a description, and start and end dates.
    - If a start date is specified, all promotions in the campaign can be used after the specified date.
    - If an end date is specified, all promotions in the campaign can't be used after the specified date.
4. Under the campaign budget, you can add limits that automatically expires the campaign, which means promotions in that campaign can't be used anymore.
    - For Type, you can choose to set the budget either based on:
        - **Usage**: How many times the promotions in the campaign can be used. Once the number of times exceed the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire.
        - **Spend**: The total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign. Once the total amount discounted exceeds the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire. This is disabled if you select the "Buy X Get Y" promotion type.
