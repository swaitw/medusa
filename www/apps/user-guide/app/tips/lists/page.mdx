In this guide, youâ€™ll get an overview of lists in Medusa including filters, searching, and more. Each domain in the Medusa Admin, such as products or orders, has a list view displaying the items in that domain. Generally, you can apply advanced filters, search for items, and sort items.

## Filter Items

Use filters to retrieve items in a list matching specific criteria.

To do that:

1. Click on the "Add filter" button at the top of the list.
2. From the dropdown, choose the criteria you want to filter by, such as Tag.
3. This shows a new set of values to filter the list by. Select the value(s) you want to filter by.

After selecting the value(s), the list only includes the items matching your filters. You can also apply multiple filters.

### Clear Filters

To clear all applied filters, click on the "Clear all" link at the end of the list of filters.

To configure the sorting of items in the list:

1. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={BarsArrowDown} alt="sort" /> button.

## Multiple Pages

Lists in the Medusa Admin span across multiple pages if the number of items in that list are more than twenty. 

You can navigate between pages using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons at the bottom of the list.
