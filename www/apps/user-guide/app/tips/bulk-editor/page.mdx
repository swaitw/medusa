## Manage Large Data in Bulk

The bulk editor allows you to edit prices or values using a spreadsheet-interface. It simplifies the editing process when working with a large number of data, and provides you with an intuitive user experience.

The bulk editor is used in different areas of the Medusa Admin, such as product-variant pricing.

## Toggle Columns View

As the bulk editor may include a large number of columns, such as the different currencies supported in your store, you can toggle the columns' visibility to focus on a subset of columns.

To do that:

1. Click on the "View" button at the top left.
2. Check or uncheck a column by clicking on it in the dropdown.

    - Press <Kbd>{getOsShortcut()}</Kbd> + <Kbd>Z</Kbd> to undo a change you made on the selected cells.

3. To apply a value of a cell to other adjacent cells:
    1. Click on a cell
    2. Hold and Drag the blue dot at the corner of that cell to the cells below it that you want to apply the value to.
    3. Once you're done, release the hold on the blue dot. The value of the first cell will be applied to the other cells.
