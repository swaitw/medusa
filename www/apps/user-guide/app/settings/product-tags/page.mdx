## View Product Tags

Product tags allow you to group products in your store by common tags. For example, you can create tags for "electronics" or "clothing" and assign them to products.

To view product tags in your store, go to Settings → Product Tags. Here, you can see a list of all the product tags you have set up in your store. You can also search, filter, and sort the product tags to find the one you are looking for.
