## Manage Currencies

Your store can support multiple currencies, allowing customers to view prices in their preferred currency. You can add or remove currencies in the store settings.

### Add Currencies

To add currencies to your store:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon at the top right of the "Currencies" section.
3. Choose Add from the dropdown.
4. In the list that opens, check the currencies you want to add to the store.
    - To enable [tax-inclusive pricing](#edit-tax-inclusive-setting-for-currency) for a currency, enable the toggle at the currency's right.
5. Once you're done, click the Save button.

### Edit Tax-Inclusive Setting for Currency

In the store's settings, you can also manage a currency's tax-inclusive price setting. During checkout, after Medusa calculates the tax of a product or shipping, it will either:

- Add the tax to the product's price (tax-exclusive pricing).
- Include the tax in the product's price (tax-inclusive pricing).

You can manage whether a currency uses tax-inclusive pricing when adding or editing it. To edit the tax-inclusive setting for a currency:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon at the right of the currency you want to edit.
3. Choose "Enable tax-inclusive pricing" or "Disable tax-inclusive pricing" from the dropdown, depending on the current setting.

### Remove Currencies

You can remove any currency from your store that isn't the default currency. You can add the currency again later if needed.

To remove a currency:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Under the Currencies section, check the checkbox next to the currencies you want to remove.
3. Press <Kbd>R</Kbd> or click the Remove button at the bottom center of the page.
4. Confirm removing the currencies by clicking the Remove button in the pop-up.

        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
