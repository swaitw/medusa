In this guide, you’ll learn what shipping profiles are and how to manage them in the Medusa Admin.

## What is a Shipping Profile?

A shipping profile groups products with similar shipping requirements, allowing you to cater shipping options specifically for those products.

For example, if your store has fragile items that are shipped differently from other products, you can create a "Fragile" shipping profile and associate it with the fragile products. Then, you can [create shipping options](../locations/page.mdx#create-shipping-options) for fragile products, and options for other products.

2. In the Shipping Configuration section, click on "Shipping Profiles".
