In this guide, you'll learn how to manage invites in your store.

## Add Admin Users through Invites

To add a new user to your team, you must invite them. The user gets a notification of the invite to sign up, but you can also manually send them the invite link to sign up.

<Note>

The form of notification sent (for example, an email) depends on what's configured in your store. If you're unsure about this, contact your technical team to configure it for you.
