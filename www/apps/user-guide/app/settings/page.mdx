Your Medusa store's settings are where you can manage your store's details, regions, sales channels, and more.

You can access your store's settings by clicking the "Settings" item at the bottom of the sidebar. This shows a settings panel with a different sidebar to manage your store's data. 

You can also go back to the main sidebar by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUturnLeft} alt="back" /> icon at the top of the sidebar.
