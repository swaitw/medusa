In this guide, you'll learn what tax regions are and how to manage them.

## What is a Tax Region?

A Tax Region represents a geographical area where you have to apply specific tax rates. For example, if you operate in the United States and Canada, you might have different tax rates for each country, and even in different states or provinces of each country.

In this case, you can create a tax region for each country you operate in and set up [sublevel tax regions](#sublevel-tax-regions) for each state or province in the country.

Each tax region has its own tax rate, and you can override the default tax rate in a region for specific products or product types.

## Sublevel Tax Regions

Tax regions for some countries like the United States have a States, Province, or Cantons section in the tax region details page. Here, you can add sublevel regions for the country.

![Sublevel regions section](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739975474/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-19_at_4.30.57_PM_ogjlp2.png)

You can also enable it for other countries that don't show this section by default. For those countries, you'll find a note at the top of the page where you can enable the sublevel regions.

![Enable sublevel regions alert](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739971332/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-19_at_3.21.51_PM_mbm8lr.png)

After enabling this setting, you'll find a "Sublevels" section in the tax region details page where you can add sublevel regions.

1. Go to the tax region's details page.
2. In the "Sublevels" section or its equivalent (such as States, Province, or Cantons), click the "Create" button.

    - If the country supports a sublevel by default, you'll find an input to select a state, province, or canton.
    - If the country doesn't support a sublevel by default, you'll find an input to enter the ISO 3166-2 code of the sublevel.
    - Under the "Default tax rate" section, you can optionally enter a name, tax rate, and tax code in their respective fields.
    - If the tax region's rates should be combined with the parent's rates, enable the "Combinable" toggle.
4. Once you're done, click the Save button.
