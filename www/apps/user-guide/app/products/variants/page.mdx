## Create Product Variant

You can only create a product variant if there are option combinations that aren't created as a variant yet. For example, if you [created a new option](../edit/page.mdx#create-options) or deleted an existing variant, you can create a new variant.

To create a product variant:

<Note title="Tip">

You can create a variant to be multi-part or a bundle, as explained in [this guide](../create/page.mdx#types-of-products-to-create).

</Note>

1. Click the "Create" button at the top right of the Variants section.
2. In the form that opens, there are two steps:
    1. Details step:
        - Enter the variant's title and optionally SKU.
        - For each option, such as Color and Size, choose the variant's value.
        - Enable the "Manage Inventory" toggle if you want Medusa to track the inventory of this variant. If disabled, the variant is always considered in stock.
        - Enable "Allow backorders" if you want to allow customers to purchase the variant even if it's out of stock.
        - Enable "Has inventory kit" if you want to add multi-part or bundled products. This will show a third step "Inventory Kits" after the Prices step.
    2. Prices step: Use the [Bulk Editor](../../tips/bulk-editor/page.mdx) to set the variant's prices for each currency and region in your store.
    3. Inventory Kits step (optional): If you enabled "Has inventory kit", you can add the parts of the kit in this step.
        - Choose an existing inventory item to be part of the kit.
        - Enter the quantity required for a single item of the variant. For example, if the variant is a bicycle and the inventory item is a wheel, you can enter `2` in the Quantity field to indicate that the variant requires two wheels.
        - To add more inventory items, click the "Add" button.
3. Once you're done, click the "Save" button.

<Note title="Tips">

- Price columns that have the <InlineIcon Icon={TaxExclusive} alt="tax-exclusive" /> icon are tax-exclusive prices. Medusa will calculate taxes during checkout and add them to this price.
- Price columns that have the <InlineIcon Icon={TaxInclusive} alt="tax-inclusive" /> icon are tax-inclusive prices. Medusa will calculate taxes during checkout as part of this price.

Tax-inclusive pricing is configured in the [currency's](../../settings/store/page.mdx#edit-tax-inclusive-setting-for-currency) or [region's](../../settings/regions/page.mdx#tax-inclusive-pricing-for-regions) settings.
