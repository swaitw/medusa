In this guide, you’ll learn how to create and manage product collections.

## Product Collections to Organize Products

A product collection is a group of products that share a common theme or purpose. For example, a summer collection can include products like swimsuits, sunglasses, and beach towels. Collections help customers find products that are relevant to them and make it easier to browse your store.

A product can be in a single collection. You can learn how to set the collection of a product in [this guide](../edit/page.mdx#manage-product-organization).

### Product Collections List

To view all product collections, go to the Products → Collections page. From here, you can see a list, filter, and search through all collections.

## Create Product Collection

To create a collection:

1. Go to the Products → Collections page.
2. Click on the Create button at the top right.
3. In the form that opens:
    1. Enter the collection's name in the Title field.
    2. The value of the Handle field is used in the collection's URL on the storefront. It allows you to create a human-readable URL for the collection. The handle must be unique across all collections, and it must contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`). If not specified, Medusa will generate a handle from the title.
4. Once done, click the Create button.

        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
