In this guide, you’ll learn how to create and manage product categories.

## Product Categories to Organize Products

A product category is a group of products that belong to a similar type or theme. For example, a "Shoes" category can include products like sneakers, boots, and sandals. Categories help customers find products that are relevant to them and make it easier to browse your store.

Categories can be nested within other categories to create a hierarchy. For example, you can have a "Shoes" category nested within a "Women's" category.

A product can be in multiple categories. You can learn how to set the categories of a product in [this guide](../edit/page.mdx#manage-product-organization).

### Product Categories List

To view all product categories, go to the Product → Categories page. From here, you can see a list, filter, and search through all categories.

## Create a Product Category

To create a product category:

1. Go to the Product → Categories page.
2. Click on the "Create" button at the top right.
3. In the form that opens, there are two steps:
    1. Details Step:
      1. Enter the category's name in the Title field. This is the only required field.
      2. The value of the Handle field is used in the category's URL on the storefront. It allows you to create a human-readable URL for the category. The handle must be unique across all categories, and it must contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`). If not specified, Medusa will generate a handle from the title.
      3. Optionally set the category's description in the Description field.
      4. In the Status field, you can change the status to "Inactive" if you don't want the category to be shown on the storefront.
      5. In the Visibility field, you can change the visibility to "Private" if you’re creating an internal category that shouldn’t be shown to the customer.
      6. Once you're done, click the "Continue" button.
    2. In the second step, you can organize the category's ranking among other categories:
      - To move the category around, use the <InlineIcon Icon={DotsSix} alt="drag" /> icon to drag categories to their correct position.
      - To nest the category, drag it under another category and move it slightly to the right.
4. Once you’re done, click the Save button.

    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its right.
