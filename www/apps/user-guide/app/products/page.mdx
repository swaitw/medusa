The Products domain is where you manage all your products, their variants, and the different ways to organize them, such as categories and collections.

You can view the list of available products in your commerce store by clicking on Products from the sidebar menu.

In the list, you can see product details such as the title, collection, status, and more. You can also search, filter, and sort the products to find the specific order you are looking for.
