The Medusa Admin dashboard uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) under the hood to manage routing. So, you can have more flexibility in routing-related customizations using some of React Router's utilities, hooks, and components.

In this chapter, you'll learn about routing-related customizations that you can use in your admin customizations using React Router.

<Note>

`react-router-dom` is available in your project by default through the Medusa packages. You don't need to install it separately.

</Note>

## Link to a Page

To link to a page in your admin customizations, you can use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`. For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["9", "Link", "Add a link to the orders page"],
  ["9", '"/orders', "Add the path without the `/app` prefix."]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-widget.tsx" highlights={highlights}
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-sdk"
import { Container } from "@medusajs/ui"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"

// The widget
const ProductWidget = () => {
  return (
    <Container className="divide-y p-0">
      <Link to={"/orders"}>View Orders</Link>
    </Container>
  )
}

// The widget's configurations
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})

export default ProductWidget
```

This adds a widget to a product's details page with a link to the Orders page. The link's path must be without the `/app` prefix.

## Admin Route Loader

<Note>

Route loaders are available starting from Medusa v2.5.1.

</Note>

In your UI route or any other custom admin route, you may need to retrieve data to use it in your route component. For example, you may want to fetch a list of products to display on a custom page.

To do that, you can export a `loader` function in the route file, which is a [React Router loader](https://reactrouter.com/6.29.0/route/loader#loader). In this function, you can fetch and return data asynchronously. Then, in your route component, you can use the [useLoaderData](https://reactrouter.com/6.29.0/hooks/use-loader-data#useloaderdata) hook from React Router to access the data.

For example, consider the following UI route created at `src/admin/routes/custom/page.tsx`:

export const loaderHighlights = [
  ["6", "loader", "Export a loader function to fetch products."],
  ["15", "useLoaderData", "Access the data returned by the loader function in the route component."],
]

```tsx title="src/admin/routes/custom/page.tsx" highlights={loaderHighlights}
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"
import {
  useLoaderData,
} from "react-router-dom"

export async function loader() {
  // TODO fetch products

  return {
    products: [],
  }
}

const CustomPage = () => {
  const { products } = useLoaderData() as Awaited<ReturnType<typeof loader>>

  return (
    <div>
      <Container className="divide-y p-0">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
          <Heading level="h2">Products count: {products.length}</Heading>
        </div>
      </Container>
    </div>
  )
}

export default CustomPage
```

In this example, you first export a `loader` function that can be used to fetch data, such as products. The function returns an object with a `products` property.

Then, in the `CustomPage` route component, you use the `useLoaderData` hook from React Router to access the data returned by the `loader` function. You can then use the data in your component.

### Route Parameters

You can also access route params in the loader function. For example, consider the following UI route created at `src/admin/routes/custom/[id]/page.tsx`:

export const loaderParamHighlights = [
  ["7", "params", "Access route params in the loader."]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/routes/custom/[id]/page.tsx" highlights={loaderParamHighlights}
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"
import {
  useLoaderData,
  LoaderFunctionArgs,
} from "react-router-dom"

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const { id } = params
  // TODO fetch product by id

  return {
    id,
  }
}

const CustomPage = () => {
  const { id } = useLoaderData() as Awaited<ReturnType<typeof loader>>

  return (
    <div>
      <Container className="divide-y p-0">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4">
          <Heading level="h2">Product ID: {id}</Heading>
        </div>
      </Container>
    </div>
  )
}

export default CustomPage
```

Because the UI route has a route parameter `[id]`, you can access the `id` parameter in the `loader` function. The loader function accepts as a parameter an object of type `LoaderFunctionArgs` from React Router. This object has a `params` property that contains the route parameters.

In the loader, you can fetch data asynchronously using the route parameter and return it. Then, in the route component, you can access the data using the `useLoaderData` hook.

### When to Use Route Loaders

A route loader is executed before the route is loaded. So, it will block navigation until the loader function is resolved.

Only use route loaders when the route component needs data essential before rendering. Otherwise, use the JS SDK with Tanstack (React) Query as explained in [this chapter](../tips/page.mdx#send-requests-to-api-routes). This way, you can fetch data asynchronously and update the UI when the data is available. You can also use a loader to prepare some initial data that's used in the route component before the data is retrieved.

## Other React Router Utilities

### Route Handles

<Note>

Route handles are available starting from Medusa v2.5.1.

</Note>

In your UI route or any route file, you can export a `handle` object to define [route handles](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/route-module#handle). The object is passed to the loader and route contexts.

For example:

```tsx title="src/admin/routes/custom/page.tsx"
export const handle = {
  sandbox: true,
}
```

### React Router Components and Hooks

Refer to [react-router-domâ€™s documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.29.0) for components and hooks that you can use in your admin customizations.
