In this chapter, you'll learn how to store workflow executions in the database and access them later.

## Workflow Execution Retention

Medusa doesn't store your workflow's execution details by default. However, you can configure a workflow to keep its execution details stored in the database.

This is useful for auditing and debugging purposes. When you store a workflow's execution, you can view details around its steps, their states and their output. You can also check whether the workflow or any of its steps failed.

<Note title="Tip">

You can view stored workflow executions from the Medusa Admin dashboard by going to Settings -> Workflows.

## How to Store Workflow's Executions?

      link: "!resources!/architectural-modules/workflow-engine/redis"
    }
  ]}
/>

`createWorkflow` from the Workflows SDK can accept an object as a first parameter to set the workflow's configuration. To enable storing a workflow's executions:

- Enable the `store` option. If your workflow is a [Long-Running Workflow](../long-running-workflow/page.mdx), this option is enabled by default.
- Set the `retentionTime` option to the number of seconds that the workflow execution should be stored in the database.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["15", "retentionTime", "The number of seconds that the workflow's executions should be stored in the database."],
  ["16", "store", "Enable storing the workflow's executions in the database."],
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  {
    name: "step-1",
  },
  async () => {
    console.log("Hello from step 1")
  }
)

export const helloWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  {
    name: "hello-workflow",
    retentionTime: 99999,
    store: true,
  },
  () => {
    step1()
  }
)
```

Whenever you execute the `helloWorkflow` now, its execution details will be stored in the database.

## Retrieve Workflow Executions

<Note title="Tip">

You can view stored workflow executions from the Medusa Admin dashboard by going to Settings -> Workflows.

</Note>

When you execute a workflow, the returned object has a `transaction` property containing the workflow execution's transaction details:

```ts
const { transaction } = await helloWorkflow(container).run()
```

To retrieve a workflow's execution details from the database, resolve the Workflow Engine Module from the container and use its `listWorkflowExecutions` method.

For example, you can create a `GET` API Route at `src/workflows/[id]/route.ts` that retrieves a workflow execution for the specified transaction ID:

export const retrieveHighlights = [
  ["8", "transaction_id", "Get the transaction ID from a path parameter."],
  ["10", "workflowEngineService", "Resolve the Workflow Engine Module from the container."],
  ["14", "workflowExecution", "Retrieve the workflow execution for the specified transaction ID."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/[id]/route.ts" highlights={retrieveHighlights}
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { transaction_id } = req.params
  
  const workflowEngineService = req.scope.resolve(
    Modules.WORKFLOW_ENGINE
  )

  const [workflowExecution] = await workflowEngineService.listWorkflowExecutions({
    transaction_id: transaction_id,
  })

  res.json({
    workflowExecution,
  })
}
```

In the above example, you resolve the Workflow Engine Module from the container and use its `listWorkflowExecutions` method, passing the `transaction_id` as a filter to retrieve its workflow execution details.

A workflow execution object will be similar to the following:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "hello-workflow",
  "transaction_id": "01JJC2T6AVJCQ3N4BRD1EB88SP",
  "id": "wf_exec_01JJC2T6B3P76JD35F12QTTA78",
  "execution": {
    "state": "done",
    "steps": {},
    "modelId": "hello-workflow",
    "options": {},
    "metadata": {},
    "startedAt": 1737719880027,
    "definition": {},
    "timedOutAt": null,
    "hasAsyncSteps": false,
    "transactionId": "01JJC2T6AVJCQ3N4BRD1EB88SP",
    "hasFailedSteps": false,
    "hasSkippedSteps": false,
    "hasWaitingSteps": false,
    "hasRevertedSteps": false,
    "hasSkippedOnFailureSteps": false
  },
  "context": {
    "data": {},
    "errors": []
  },
  "state": "done",
  "created_at": "2025-01-24T09:58:00.036Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-24T09:58:00.046Z",
  "deleted_at": null
}
```

### Example: Check if Stored Workflow Execution Failed

To check if a stored workflow execution failed, you can check its `state` property:

```ts
if (workflowExecution.state === "failed") {
  return res.status(500).json({
    error: "Workflow failed",
  })
}
```

Other state values include `done`, `invoking`, and `compensating`.
