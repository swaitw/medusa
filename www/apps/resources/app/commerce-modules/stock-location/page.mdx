In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Stock Location Module and how to use it in your application.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

Refer to the [Medusa Admin User Guide](!user-guide!/settings/locations-and-shipping) to learn how to manage stock locations using the dashboard.

</Note>

Medusa has stock location related features available out-of-the-box through the Stock Location Module. A [module](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Medusa's commerce features are placed in commerce modules, such as this Stock Location Module.

<Note>

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

## Stock Location Features

- [Stock Location Management](/references/stock-location-next/models): Store and manage stock locations. Medusa links stock locations with data models of other modules that require a location, such as the [Inventory Module's InventoryLevel](./links-to-other-modules/page.mdx).
- [Address Management](/references/stock-location-next/models/StockLocationAddress): Manage the address of each stock location.

## How to Use Stock Location Module's Service

In your Medusa application, you build flows around commerce modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism. 

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Medusa's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["12", "Modules.STOCK_LOCATION", "Resolve the module in a step."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-stock-location.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const createStockLocationStep = createStep(
  "create-stock-location",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const stockLocationModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.STOCK_LOCATION)

    const stockLocation = await stockLocationModuleService.createStockLocations({
      name: "Warehouse 1",
    })

    return new StepResponse({ stockLocation }, stockLocation.id)
  },
  async (stockLocationId, { container }) => {
    if (!stockLocationId) {
      return
    }
    const stockLocationModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.STOCK_LOCATION)

    await stockLocationModuleService.deleteStockLocations([stockLocationId])
  }
)

export const createStockLocationWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-stock-location",
  () => {
    const { stockLocation } = createStockLocationStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({ stockLocation })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

<CodeTabs group="resource-types">
  <CodeTab label="API Route" value="api-route">
    
```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-stock-location"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Subscriber" value="subscriber">
    
```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-stock-location"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Scheduled Job" value="scheduled-job">
    
```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts" highlights={[["7"], ["8"]]}
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-stock-location"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>
