# {metadata.title}

This document showcases the module links defined between the Store Module and other commerce modules.

## Summary

The Store Module has the following links to other modules:

<Note title="Tip">

Read-only links are used to query data across modules, but the relations aren't stored in a pivot table in the database.

</Note>

- [`Currency` data model \<\> `Currency` data model of Currency Module](#currency-module). (Read-only).

## Currency Module

The Store Module has a `Currency` data model that stores the supported currencies of a store. However, these currencies don't hold all the details of a currency, such as its name or symbol.

Instead, Medusa defines a read-only link between the [Currency Module](../../currency/page.mdx)'s `Currency` data model and the Store Module's `Currency` data model. This means you can retrieve the details of a store's supported currencies, but you don't manage the links in a pivot table in the database. The currencies of a store are determined by the `currency_code` of the `Currency` data model in the Store Module.

### Retrieve with Query

To retrieve the details of a store's currencies with [Query](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query), pass `supported_currencies.currency.*` in `fields`:

<CodeTabs group="relation-query">
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="method">

```ts
const { data: stores } = await query.graph({
  entity: "store",
  fields: [
    "supported_currencies.currency.*",
  ],
})

// stores.supported_currencies
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="step">

```ts
import { useQueryGraphStep } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

// ...

const { data: stores } = useQueryGraphStep({
  entity: "store",
  fields: [
    "supported_currencies.currency.*",
  ],
})

// stores.supported_currencies
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>
