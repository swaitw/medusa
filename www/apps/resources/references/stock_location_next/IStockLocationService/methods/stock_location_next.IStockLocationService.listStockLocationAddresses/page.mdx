# listStockLocationAddresses - Stock Location Next Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listStockLocationAddresses` method. This belongs to the Stock Location Next Module.

You should only use this methods when implementing complex customizations. For common cases, check out [available workflows instead](/medusa-workflows-reference).

</Note>

This method retrieves a paginated list of stock location addresses based on optional filters and configuration.
