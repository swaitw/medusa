# How to Create a Payment Provider

In this document, youâ€™ll learn how to create a Payment Provider to be used with the Payment Module.

---

## Understanding Payment Provider Implementation

The Payment Module Provider handles processing payment with a third-party provirder. However, it's not responsible for managing payment concepts within Medusa, such as payment sessions or collections. These concepts are handled by the Payment Module which uses your payment provider within core operations.

For example, when the merchant captures an order's payment, the Payment Module uses the payment provider to capture the payment, the makes updates to the `Payment` record associated with the order. So, you only have to implement the third-party payment processing logic in your payment provider.

---

## 1. Create Module Provider Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your module provider.

If you're creating the module provider in a Medusa application, create it under the `src/modules` directory. For example, `src/modules/my-payment`.

If you're creating the module provider in a plugin, create it under the `src/providers` directory. For example, `src/providers/my-payment`.

<Note>

The rest of this guide always uses the `src/modules/my-payment` directory as an example.

</Note>

---

## 2. Create the Payment Provider Service

Create the file `src/modules/my-payment/service.ts` that holds the module's main service. It must extend the `AbstractPaymentProvider` class imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`:

```ts title="src/modules/my-payment/service.ts"
import { AbstractPaymentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  // TODO implement methods
}

export default MyPaymentProviderService
```

### constructor

The constructor allows you to access resources from the [module's container](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules/container)
using the first parameter, and the module's options using the second parameter.

:::note

A module's options are passed when you register it in the Medusa application.

:::

#### Example

```ts
import { AbstractPaymentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Logger } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {
  logger: Logger
}

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<Options> {
  protected logger_: Logger
  protected options_: Options
  // assuming you're initializing a client
  protected client

  constructor(
    container: InjectedDependencies,
    options: Options
  ) {
    super(container, options)

    this.logger_ = container.logger
    this.options_ = options

    // TODO initialize your client
  }
  // ...
}

export default MyPaymentProviderService
```

#### Type Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"TConfig","type":"`object`","description":"The type of the provider's options passed as a second parameter.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="AbstractPaymentProvider"/>

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"cradle","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"The module's container cradle used to resolve resources.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="AbstractPaymentProvider"/>

### identifier

Each payment provider has a unique identifier defined in its class. The provider's ID
will be stored as `pp_{identifier}_{id}`, where `{id}` is the provider's `id`
property in the `medusa-config.ts`.

#### Example

```ts
class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  static identifier = "my-payment"
  // ...
}
```

### validateOptions

This method validates the options of the provider set in `medusa-config.ts`.
Implementing this method is optional. It's useful if your provider requires custom validation.

If the options aren't valid, throw an error.

#### Example

```ts
class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<Options> {
  static validateOptions(options: Record<any, any>) {
    if (!options.apiKey) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "API key is required in the provider's options."
      )
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"options","type":"`Record<any, any>`","description":"The provider's options.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="validateOptions"/>

### capturePayment

This method is used to capture a payment. The payment is captured in one of the following scenarios:

- The [authorizePayment](page.mdx#authorizepayment) method returns the status `captured`, which automatically executed this method after authorization.
- The merchant requests to capture the payment after its associated payment session was authorized.
- A webhook event occurred that instructs the payment provider to capture the payment session. Learn more about handing webhook events in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/payment/webhook-events).

In this method, use the third-party provider to capture the payment.

#### Example

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  CapturePaymentInput,
  CapturePaymentOutput,
} from "@medusajs/framework/types"

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  async capturePayment(
    input: CapturePaymentInput
  ): Promise<CapturePaymentOutput> {
    const externalId = input.data?.id

      // assuming you have a client that captures the payment
    const newData = await this.client.capturePayment(externalId)
    return {data: newData}
  }
  // ...
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[CapturePaymentInput](../../../types/interfaces/types.CapturePaymentInput/page.mdx)","description":"The input to capture the payment. The `data` field should contain the data from the payment provider. when the payment was created.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"Data is a combination of the input from the user and what is stored in the database for the associated model.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"context","type":"[PaymentProviderContext](../../../types/interfaces/types.PaymentProviderContext/page.mdx)","description":"The context for this payment operation.

Throws in case of an error.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"PaymentProviderOutput","type":"`object`","description":"The response of operations on a payment.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="capturePayment"/>

### authorizePayment

This method authorizes a payment session. When authorized successfully, a payment is created by the Payment
Module which can be later captured using the [capturePayment](page.mdx#capturepayment) method.

Refer to [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/payment/payment-flow#3-authorize-payment-session)
to learn more about how this fits into the payment flow and how to handle required actions.

To automatically capture the payment after authorization, return the status `captured`.

#### Example

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  AuthorizePaymentInput,
  AuthorizePaymentOutput,
  PaymentSessionStatus
} from "@medusajs/framework/types"

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  async authorizePayment(
    input: AuthorizePaymentInput
  ): Promise<AuthorizePaymentOutput> {
    const externalId = input.data?.id

    // assuming you have a client that authorizes the payment
    const paymentData = await this.client.authorizePayment(externalId)

    return {

## 3. Create Module Definition File

Create the file `src/modules/my-payment/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/my-payment/index.ts"
import MyPaymentProviderService from "./service"
import { 
  ModuleProvider, 
  Modules
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default ModuleProvider(Modules.PAYMENT, {
  services: [MyPaymentProviderService],
})
```

This exports the module's definition, indicating that the `MyPaymentProviderService` is the module's service.

---

## 4. Use Module

To use your Payment Module Provider, add it to the `providers` array of the Payment Module in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/payment",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            // if module provider is in a plugin, use `plugin-name/providers/my-payment`
            resolve: "./src/modules/my-payment",
            id: "my-payment",
            options: {
              // provider options...
              apiKey: "..."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

---

## 5. Test it Out

Before you use your payment provider, enable it in a region using the Medusa Admin.

Then, go through checkout to place an order. Your payment provider is used to authorize the payment.
