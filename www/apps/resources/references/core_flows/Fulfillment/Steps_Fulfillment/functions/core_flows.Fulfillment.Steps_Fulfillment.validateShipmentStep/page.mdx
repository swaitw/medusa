# validateShipmentStep - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `validateShipmentStep`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This step validates that a shipment can be created for a fulfillment.
If the shipment has already been created, the fulfillment has been canceled,
or the fulfillment does not have a shipping option, the step throws an error.

```ts title="src/workflows/my-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { validateShipmentStep } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "my-workflow",
  () => {
    const data = validateShipmentStep("{value}")
  }
)
```
