# deleteProductsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteProductsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more products. It's used by the 
[Delete Products Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products\_deleteproductsid).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the products are deleted. For example, 
you can delete custom records linked to the products.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product deletion.
