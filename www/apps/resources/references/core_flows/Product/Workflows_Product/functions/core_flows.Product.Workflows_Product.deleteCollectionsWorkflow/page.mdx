# deleteCollectionsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteCollectionsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more product collections. It's used by the 
[Delete Product Collection Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#collections\_deletecollectionsid).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the product collections are deleted. For example, 
you can delete custom records linked to the product colleciton.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product-collection deletion.
