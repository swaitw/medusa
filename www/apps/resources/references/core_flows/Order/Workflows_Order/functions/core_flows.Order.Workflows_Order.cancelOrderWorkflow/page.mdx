# cancelOrderWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `cancelOrderWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow cancels an order. An order can only be canceled if it doesn't have
any fulfillments, or if all fulfillments are canceled. The workflow will also cancel
any uncaptured payments, and refund any captured payments.

This workflow is used by the [Cancel Order Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidcancel).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the canceled order. For example, you can 
make changes to custom models linked to the order.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around canceling an order.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).
