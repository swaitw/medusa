# deleteCustomerAddressesWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteCustomerAddressesWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more customer addresses. It's used by the
[Remove Customer Addresses Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#customers\_deletecustomersidaddressesaddress\_id)
and the [Remove Customer Addresses Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#customers\_deletecustomersmeaddressesaddress\_id).

:::note

This workflow deletes addresses created by the [Customer Module](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/customer)
only. So, you can't delete addresses attached to a cart, for example. To do that, use the workflow
relevant to that module.

:::

You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to 
delete customer addresses in your custom flows.
